After installation, you need to edit & run all files wil focused on the "Company" folder (parent of repository) to link with node modules.
To run, while in a terminal at "C:\path\Company" (C means your hard drive) run the command "npm run dev", you will get a link, and the page will be run on the local host.
Note that the program runs on typescript, and no compiling is needed after editing typescript files, since the project is overseen with Vite.
